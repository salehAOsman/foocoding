To create a hidden file: we write 'touch' then '.' point then 'name file'
exmple: filename = 'HelloGitHub.txt'
touch .HelloGitHub.txt 
To display it we write this 
ls -a

2. How to create multiple nested directories with one mkdir command?
To do it write 'mkdir' then  '-p' then all path 'c/Users/unmesh/these/folders/are/just/for/fun.txt'
exmple: mkdir -p c/Users/unmesh/these/folders/are/just/for/fun.txt

3. How to execute following commands terminal:
    echo "test" > fun                       : It will add string to a clear file that has name 'fun' if file not exist it will create it
    echo "another test" >> fun              : It will append this string to a file that has name 'fun' if file not exist it will create it
    wc -c fun                               : It will count characters in the file thart has name 'fun'
     //the output will be
    '18'      chars    
    
4. To append something in the file.
echo test > fun                             
echo another test >> fun
cat fun
The output is:
test
another test

How would you use echo command, so that output would be: 'testanother test'?
The command will like this:   
tr -d '\n' < fun.txt
